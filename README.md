# Bootcamp-Project #14: Express API Project
This week's project was about creating an API using Express. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays
This week was a lot of new things to wrap my head around. Not only going from frontend to the backend but also working with Postman as a new tool. Still it was very much fun, since I love closing gaps and to see where and how everything is connected, which I kind of started to see with this project. But even though everything seems to work and the requirements are fullfilled I'm looking forward to the next project, since I am still missing some parts to fully understand where this journey is heading.
