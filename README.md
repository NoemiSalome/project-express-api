# Express API Project

This weeks project was about our first step into back-end by building our first API. 

## The problem

I was looking forward to this week, but unfortunately I had too little time for coding this week. So I'll definitely need to go back to this project, cause I am a bit confused by some parts of it. Also I am missing something in my code. I seem not to be able to filter by language_code and author, but couldn't quite figure out what it is. 
Luckily I am off work next week, so I'll have more time then to go back to it.
